#+filetags: :computer-science:operating-system:

A [[id:7ba23e43-9f67-4502-a54b-e6a2bd647371][thread]] can terminates in a number of ways:

 * it terminates normally by returning from its entry point function
 * it terminates explicitly by calling functions such as
   ~pthread_exit()~
 * it is /killed/ by another thread, however, it may ignore the
   request
 * it is terminates with the process it belongs to
