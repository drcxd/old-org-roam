#+title: __m128 Data Type
#+filetags: :computer-science:SIMD:

The =__m128= type encapsulates a packed array of four =float=​s for use
with with the SSE [[id:4869568e-2c8b-43d0-92b6-e8b1a5402816][Compiler Intrinsics]].

Declaring local variables or function arguments of =__m128= type
usually makes the compiler treats them as direct proxies of SSE
registers. However, declaring global variables, members, or sometimes
local variables of =__m128= type makes the data being stored as
16-byte-aligned  =float=​s in memory.

Global, local of =__m128= type is automatically 16-byte
aligned. Member variables of =__m128= type is also aligned /relative/
to the starting address of the class/structure. However, dynamically
allocated class/structure instances containing =__m128= members must
be aligned manually.
