Part of an [[id:7fd3d0a9-74c5-455b-9d44-dd06c844a845][executable image]]. "BSS" is an outdated name which stands
for "block started by symbol".[fn:1]

This section contains all the program's uninitialized global
variables. C/C++ explicitly define the initial value of any
uninitialized variables to be zero. However, rather than storing a
large contiuous blocks of zeros, BSS section only stores the number of
bytes thoes variables required and allocate and initialize them to
zero when the program starts.
