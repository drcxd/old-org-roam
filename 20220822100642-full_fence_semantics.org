#+title: Full Fence Semantics
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

This semantic guarantees that all memory operations appear to occur in
program order across the boundary created by a fence instruction in
the code. No read/write operations occur after the fence can appear to
occur before the fence, and no read/write operations occur before the
fence can appear to occur after the fence.
