#+title: Atomic Reads and Writes
#+filetags: :concurrency:computer-science:

On most CPUs, it can be reasonably certain that a read or write of a
four-byte-aligned 32-bit integer will be atomic.

Some CPU also support atomic reads and writes of smaller or larger
objects as long as they are aligned to a multiple of their own size.
