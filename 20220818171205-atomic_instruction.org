#+title: Atomic Instruction
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

Atomic instructions are machine language instructions defined by ISA
that are /uninterruptable/. Note that not all machine language
instructions are uninterruptable. Some instructions are only
uninterruptable when operating on certain kinds of data. Certain ISA
permits instructions to be /forced/ to execute atomically by
specifying a prefix on the instruction in assembly langugae.

Atomic instructions are the building block of higher level [[id:9af69701-95e6-42fd-a81b-fb59387d4d7e][atomic
operation]] and tools such as mutexes and spin locks.

Generally, atomic instructions falls into one of two categories:

+ [[id:a36d93f8-6e97-45a7-950a-6ec170d558d7][Atomic Read-Modify-Write]] (RMW)
