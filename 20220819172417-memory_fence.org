#+title: Memory Fence
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

Modern CPUs provide special machine language instructions known as
memory fences to enforce ordering of memory-read/write
operations. Memory fences also serve as [[id:25e2f5b2-834a-4bde-a257-5b8b20878d99][Compiler Barrier]]s and prevent
CPU-level instruction reordering.

Different ISAs may provide different sets of memory-fence instructions
