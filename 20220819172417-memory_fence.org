#+title: Memory Fence
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

Modern CPUs provide special machine language instructions known as
memory fences to enforce ordering of memory-read/write
operations. Memory fences also serve as [[id:25e2f5b2-834a-4bde-a257-5b8b20878d99][Compiler Barrier]]s and prevent
CPU-level instruction reordering.

Different ISAs may provide different sets of memory-fence
instructions, but in general, we can reason about their semantics.

There are three memory ordering semantics:

1. [[id:fb00a83d-6b52-4127-af9d-a37f7c74d463][Release Semantics]]
2. [[id:0ee8d118-5613-4d7b-b354-7e09d05ccad4][Acquire Semantics]]
3. [[id:dbdb0565-45ff-4a8a-8f7a-42fcc33cc846][Full Fence Semantics]]
