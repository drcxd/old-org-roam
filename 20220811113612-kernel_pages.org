#+title: Kernel Space
#+filetags: :operating-system:computer-science:

The address space of a [[id:a53f7936-135e-410f-89cd-3a4935e43c6a][process]] is usually divided into two large
contiguous blocks: user space and kernel space.

User space is mapped through a [[id:7fdbb75a-f086-4991-98a7-ae300911eabf][page table]] that is unique to each
process. Kernel space uses a separate page table that is shared by all
processes. Thus, all processes share the same view of kernel memory.

Processes can only access kernal space through [[id:806da37a-e8ad-4338-9453-f691bcac057f][system call]], otherwise,
a page fault will occur and the program will crash.
