#+title: Atomic Read-Modify-Write
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

[[id:596b0a8c-b1bb-4e22-b9a0-1a855d1181a8][Atomic Reads and Writes]] are not enough to implement [[id:9af69701-95e6-42fd-a81b-fb59387d4d7e][Atomic
Operation]]s. An atomic read-modify-write instruction reads value from
memory, performs some operation on it then writes the result back to
memory. All modern CPUs support concurrency by providing at least one
atomic read-modify-write (RMW) instruction.

Here are some typical atomic read-modify-write instructions:
