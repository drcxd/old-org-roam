Compare-and-swap (CAS) is an [[id:a36d93f8-6e97-45a7-950a-6ec170d558d7][Atomic Read-Modify-Write]] instruction
which checks the existing value in memroy and atomically swaps the
value with a new value if and only if the existing value is the same
as another expected value. It returns true if the operation succeeded,
false if the operation failed.

Compare-and-swap is vulnerable to a problem known as ABA problem.
