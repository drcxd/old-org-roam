#+title: Compiler Intrinsics
#+filetags: :computer-science:SIMD:

Compilers provide /intrinsics/: special syntax that looks and behaves
like C function but is converted to inline assembly code by the
compilers.

They are used to write more portable code involving special assembly
language instructions that are not portable at all. For example, the
SSE and AVX assembly language instructions, or the pause instruction
that is used in spin-lock.
