#+title: Virtual Memory
#+filetags: :operating-system:computer-science:

Virtual memory is a mechanism used to protect [[id:f4adfdc5-5e68-41d0-ba31-9aad7297fc12][user program]]s from
directly access the physical memory, so user programs could not stomp
over each other and corrupt operating system memory.

Virtual memory is also useful when memory more than the machine's
physical memory is requested by swapping out [[id:20155c50-78ff-4b37-a066-f7f93a1725d4][page]]s which are not used
currently to disk.
