A [[id:7ba23e43-9f67-4502-a54b-e6a2bd647371][thread]] can be in one of three states:

1. Running :: the thread is actively running on a core.
2. Runnable :: the thread is able to run but is waiting to receive a
   time slice on a core.
3. Blocked :: the thread is asleep, waiting for some condition to
   become true.

* Transition of States
** Running to Runnable
The thread has used up its time slice and is stopped by the operating
system.
** Running to Block
The thread is blocked by calling a blocking function, or waiting on
some conditiong.
** Block to Runnable
The operating system wakes the thread up since the condition it's
waiting on become true.
** Runnable to Running
The thread is scheduled to run by the operating system.
