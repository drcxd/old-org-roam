A thread is an encapsulation of a running instance of a stream of
machine language instructions.

Threads are the unit of program execution within an operating system,
not processes.

Each thread is comprised of :
 * an unique thread id within its process
 * the thread's [[id:3e87032c-4614-4507-92c3-6eb3f86aa7c3][call stack]]
 * the values of registers
 * a block of general purpose storage associated with each thread,
   known as /thread local storgae/ (TLS)
