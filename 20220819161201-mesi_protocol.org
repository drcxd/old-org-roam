MESI is a widely used [[id:0dd5cfd0-e2d1-4d3e-8d08-a3e9b18bf636][Cache Coherency Protocol]].

Under this protocol, each cache line can be in one of four states:

+ Modified. This cache line has been modified locally.
+ Exclusive. The main RAM block corresponding to this cache line
  exists only in this core's L1 cache.
+ Shared. More than one core's L1 cache holds a copy of the main RAM
  block corresponding to this cache line. All cores has identical copy
  of it.
+ Invalid. This cache line no longer contains valid data. The next
  read from this cache line need to obtain data from other L1 cache or
  main RAM.
