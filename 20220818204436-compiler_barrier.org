#+title: Compiler Barrier
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

Compiler barriers are pseudoinstructions specific to compilers. They
are used to prevent compilers from reordering instructions across
them. However, they only works on the compiler-level, which means they
can not stop CPUs from reordering machine language instructions.
