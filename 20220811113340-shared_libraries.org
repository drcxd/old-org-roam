#+title: Shared Libraries
#+filetags: :computer-science:operating-system:

Programs using shared libraries still have unresolved symbols when they
are compiled into executable files.

When the program luanched, the operating system will also load the
shared libraries it needs if they are not already loaded and maps a
view of them into the process's [[id:794b11a0-038d-4769-8d9f-eebd91efd9b4][memory map]]. The addresses
of functions and global variables provided by shared libraries are
patched into the program's machine code.

The benefit of using shared library is that when multiple programs use
the same shared library, there is only one instance of it in the memory.
