#+title: ABA Problem
#+filetags: :computer-science:concurrency:

ABA problem happens when a program try to use [[id:d4bd1682-59c2-4513-945f-fd18e47e93cd][Compare and Swap]] to
achieve correct concurrency.

Consider a thread reads a value =A= from some location in
memory. Before it could use the compare-and-swap instruction to write
the modified value back, it is interrupted by another thread, which
writes the value to =B=, and then to =A= again. Then, the first thread
is woke up and continue to execute. The CAS instruction cannot detect
that the value has been changed and the write would succeed.
