A process is the unit an operating system uses to manage an running
instance of a program contained in an executable file.

A process consists of:
 * a /process id (PID)/ that uniquely defines the process within the
   operating system
 * a set of /permissions/
 * a reference to the process's /parent process/, if any
 * a [[id:794b11a0-038d-4769-8d9f-eebd91efd9b4][virtual memory space]] defines the process's "view" of physical
   memory
 * the values of /environment variables/
 * all open /file handles/ in use by the process
 * the current /working directory/ of the process
 * resources for managing /synchronization/ and /communication/
   between processes in the system, such as message queues, pipes and
   semaphores
 * one or more [[id:7ba23e43-9f67-4502-a54b-e6a2bd647371][thread]]s

Each process has its own page table. A process's [[id:7fdbb75a-f086-4991-98a7-ae300911eabf][page table]] defines
its [[id:794b11a0-038d-4769-8d9f-eebd91efd9b4][memory map]].
