Coroutines are a particular type of user-level thread. Coroutines does
not block or sleep. Coroutines also have no scheduler. Coroutines only
yields to other coroutines. When a coroutine yields, its [[id:e83c7ebf-cc75-43a2-8fe3-d72dba205dd4][execution
context]] is stored in memory. Since switching between coroutines does
not involve kernel, it is more efficient than switching between threads.
