- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 16:57] \\

  branches can be executed safely.

**** Complexity of Superscalar Designs
**** Superscalar and RISC
*** Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)
** Explicit Parallelism
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:10] \\
  Explicit parallelism is designed to make concurrent software run
  more efficiently. Hence all explicitly parallel hardware designs
  permit mor than one instruction stream to be processed in parallel.

*** Symmetric versus Asymmetric Multiprocessing
*** Distributed Computing
** Operating System Fundamentals
*** The Kernel
**** Kernel Mode versus User Mode
**** Kernal Mode Privileges
*** Interrupts
*** Kernel Calls
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:43] \\
  In order for user software to perform a privileged operation, the user
  program must make a request to the kernel. Such a request is called a
  /kernel call/ or /system call/.
*** Preemptive Multitasking
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:50] \\
  To implement preemptive multitasking, the operating system responds to
  a regularly-timed hardware interrupt in order to periodically /context
  switch/ between the different programs running on the system.
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:49] \\
  The time slice during witch one particular program is allowed to run on the CPU is sometimes called the program's /quantum/.
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:48] \\
  In preemptive multitasking, programs still share the CPU by
  time-slicing. However the scheduling of programs is controlled by the
  operating system, not via cooperation between the programs themselves.
*** Processes
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:54] \\
  A /process/ is the operating system's way of managing a /running
  instance/ of a program contained in an /executable file/.
**** Anatomy of a Process
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 18:02] \\
  Threads are the /fundamental unit of program execution/ within an
  operating system, not processes. A process merely provides an
  /environment/ within which its thread(s) can run, including a
  virtual memory map and a set of /resources/ that are used by and
  shared between all threads within that process.
- Note taken on [2022-08-09 Tue 17:59] \\
  A /thread/ encapsulates a running instance of a single stream of
  machine language instructions.
