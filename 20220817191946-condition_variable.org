#+title: Condition Variable
#+filetags: :computer-science:operating-system:concurrency:

Condition variable is one of the [[id:83d50ae1-7ae2-480a-be80-8a96fc193150][thread synchronization primitives]]
provided by operating systems. Although named condition variable, it
is actually a waiting queue. It allows [[id:7ba23e43-9f67-4502-a54b-e6a2bd647371][thread]]s to wait for some
condition to become true or notify other sleeping threads to wake up.

Since it is an object shared between threads, it must be used with a
[[id:74b8b695-b415-4025-bd57-b98a8fb846b2][mutex]] to ensure it is accessed atomicly.

Threads waiting on a condition variable might be woke up by the
operating system /spuriously/, that is it is woke up when the
condition it is waiting for is not ture yet, so usually the wait
operation is done in a loop.
